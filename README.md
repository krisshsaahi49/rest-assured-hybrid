# API Testing Framework for Swagger User Endpoints

This project is a REST API testing framework built with Java. It uses several libraries and tools to perform comprehensive API testing, including:

- **RestAssured** for API interactions
- **TestNG** for test orchestration
- **ExtentReports** for generating detailed test reports
- **Apache POI** for reading test data from Excel files
- **Log4j** for logging

The framework demonstrates both data-driven testing (using Excel as a source) and regression tests with dynamically generated test data.

```

- **com.dto.User.java**  
  Contains the User data transfer object (DTO) built with Lombok annotations.

- **com.util**  
  Includes utility classes:
  - **BaseUtil.java:** Implements TestNG listeners for logging and reporting.
  - **DataProviders.java:** Provides data for data-driven tests via TestNG's `@DataProvider` annotation.
  - **ExcelUtil.java:** Reads test data from an Excel file using Apache POI.
  - **ExtentReportUtil.java:** Manages test reporting using ExtentReports.
  - **LogUtil.java:** Handles logging using Log4j.

- **com.endpoints**  
  Contains endpoint definitions:
  - **Routes.java:** Defines the base URL and endpoint paths.
  - **UserEndpoint.java:** Provides methods to create, read, update, and delete user data via REST calls.

- **Test Classes**
  - **UserDDT.java:** Executes data-driven tests using test data from an Excel sheet.
  - **UserTest.java:** Performs regression tests using dynamic test data generated by Faker.

---

## pom.xml

The project is managed using Maven. The **pom.xml** file includes all the necessary dependencies and plugins to build and run the tests. Key details include:

- **Dependencies:**
  - **RestAssured** (including json-schema-validator and json-path) for REST API testing.
  - **TestNG** for test execution.
  - **Jackson Databind** and **org.json** for JSON parsing.
  - **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code.
  - **Apache POI & POI-Ooxml** for Excel file operations.
  - **ExtentReports** for generating test reports.
  - **JavaFaker** for generating dynamic test data.
  - **Log4j (log4j-core and log4j-api)** for logging.

- **Plugins:**
  - **Maven Compiler Plugin:** Configured to use Java 17 and set up the Lombok annotation processor.
  - **Maven Surefire Plugin:** Configured to run TestNG tests using a specified suite XML file.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 8 or higher** (Java 17 is recommended as per the pom.xml configuration)
- **Maven** (for dependency management and build)
- The following Maven dependencies are used:
  - RestAssured
  - TestNG
  - ExtentReports
  - Apache POI
  - Log4j
  - Faker
  - Lombok

Ensure you have the necessary environment set up and all dependencies installed.

---

## Setup and Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Import the Project:**

   Import the project into your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. **Build the Project:**

   If using Maven, run:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Configure Test Data:**

   Place your Excel test data file (`user_data.xlsx`) in the `src/resources/testdata/` directory. Modify the file path in `ExcelUtil.java` if necessary.

5. **Run Tests:**

   You can run tests from your IDE or via the command line:

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

   Alternatively, specify the suite XML file via the Maven Surefire Plugin configuration if needed.

---

## Reporting and Logging

- **ExtentReports:**  
  Test results are generated as an HTML report in the `./reports/` directory with a timestamped file name.

- **Logging:**  
  Detailed logs are produced using Log4j. Logs can be found in the console or in the designated log file based on your Log4j configuration.

---

## Data-Driven Testing

- **ExcelUtil & DataProviders:**  
  The framework uses `ExcelUtil` to read test data from an Excel file and passes the data to tests via TestNG’s `@DataProvider` annotations in `DataProviders.java`.

- **UserDDT:**  
  This class demonstrates data-driven testing by iterating through user data from the Excel file to create users and verify user retrieval.

---

## API Endpoints

- **Base URL:**  
  `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2`

- **Endpoints:**
  - **POST_USER:** `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user`
  - **GET_USER:** `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}`
  - **UPDATE_USER:** `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}`
  - **DELETE_USER:** `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/user/{username}`

These endpoints are defined in `Routes.java` and utilized in `UserEndpoint.java`.

---

## Docker

The project includes a Dockerfile for building an image that runs your tests using Maven with your TestNG suite. This ensures a consistent, reproducible environment.

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use an official Maven + Java 17 image as the base
FROM maven:3.9.0-eclipse-temurin-17

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the pom.xml first and download dependencies
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy the rest of your project files
COPY . .

# By default, run your test suite using the testng.xml file
CMD ["mvn", "clean", "test", "-DxmlName=testng.xml"]
```

### How to Build and Run the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t restassured-tests .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run --rm restassured-tests
   ```

3. **Accessing Reports and Logs:**

   If your tests generate reports and logs in directories (e.g., `/reports` and `/logs`), consider mounting a volume so you can view them on your host system:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/reports:/app/reports -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs restassured-tests
   ```

This will map the container's `/app/reports` and `/app/logs` directories to your local directories.

---

## Additional Notes

- **TestNG Listeners:**  
  The `BaseUtil` class implements TestNG listeners to integrate reporting and logging seamlessly with the test execution lifecycle.

- **Exception Handling:**  
  The project includes basic exception handling. Customize and extend these mechanisms as needed for your use cases.

- **Extensibility:**  
  This framework is designed to be modular. You can add more endpoints, extend reporting features, or incorporate additional data sources as needed.
